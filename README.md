# Social-Network-API

## Description

My motivation for creating this project was to create an social networking API that could allow users to post their thoughts, add friends, and react to their thoughts. I built this project was to make my own attempt at a social networking platform. This helps to create engagement amongst friends and the ability to meet new friends. I had initial difficulty routing the initial coding, but managed to overcome that and successfully get it to route for the users. While the thoughts did route correctly, it continued to show an empty array in response.

## Installation

You can install this application by downloading the repository to your local computer, and running npm install in the command terminal.

## Usage

Once the application is installed, you can use ```npm run dev``` to open the Insomnia application. In there, you'll want to include your localhost url followed by /api/users or /api/thoughts. You can use this to find and create users and thoughts, as well as add friends.
